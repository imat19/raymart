          <p>The film opens to a wave of comets, shooting across the sky. </p>

          <p>Two teenagers, Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu begin to speak, almost simultaneously. They speak of
            time
            and of
            dreams, and how each can be a great loss.
          </p>

          <p> A piece of one comet breaks off and plummets to the earth</p>

          <p>We see Mitsuha struggle in her sleep. She calls out to Taki, asking him if he remembers.</p>

          <p> Mitsuha wakes up. But it is not her really. It is Taki, who is freaked out to be in a girls body (though
            not
            above
            copping a feel on Mitsuha's breasts). Mitsuhas younger sister Yotsuha comes into her room, noticing her
            being
            weird again and tells her breakfast is ready. Taki, as Mitsuha, disrobes and looks in the mirror, freaked
            out
            by the strange dream he keeps having; waking up as a girl.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going downstairs, apparently back to her normal self, Mitsuha eats with, Hitoha, who is their grandmother
            and
            guardian. Hitoha and Yotsuha note that Mitsuha had been acting weird the day before. They watch a broadcast
            that notes that a comet not seen for over a thousand years will be able to be seen in the sky in a months
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mitsuha walks to school and meets up with her friends Katsuhiko and Sayaka. As they walk, they see a
            campaign
            speech
            by the local mayor, who is up for reelection. As she walks by, the man screams at Mitsuha to stand up
            straight.
            We realize that the mayor is actually Mitsuhas father, estranged from the rest of the family for unknown
            reasons.
            At school, Mitsuha flips through a notebook, and finds a note. It reads, "Who Are You?"
          </p>
          <p>Later, Mitsuha learns that the day before she had forgotten her classroom and where her locker was. This
            information
            shocks and surprises her. Sayaka chalks it up to stress Mitsuha is under to perform a Miko ritual for the
            shrine, something Mitsuha doesn't want to be reminded of. As the three walk home, they bemoan how small
            their
            too of Itomori is; there are no restaurants, bookstores, or social scene. Mitsuha herself dreams of
            graduatio
            school o she can move to Tokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Katsuhiko suggests they go to a café. The girls scream out excited. In actuality, it is just a vending
            machine
            nearby a park bench. Mitsuha goes home, leaving Sayaka with Katsuhiko. Sayaka asks him about his future
            plans.
            Katsuhiko says he will most likely just stay in town like he always has after graduation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mitsuha, Yotsuha, and Hitoha practice the art of Kumihimo (braid making). Hitoha tells them the importance
            of
            what they are creating.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mayor meets with Katsuhiko's father, who is part of the local construction union, in order to get the
            support ofhis men for the upcoming election. Katsuhiko is told by his father that he will work with them the
            followingweekendto his annoyance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next night, Mitsuha and Yotsuha perform the ritual for their shrine with includes ritualized dancing and
            the
            creation of Kuchikamizake; a sake in which someone chews rice into a paste and spits it back into a bowl,
            allowing
            it to ferment into alcohol. A few of Mitsuhas classmates walk by the ritual and mock her, to her annoyance.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they walk home Yotsuha tells her big sister not to take it so personally, but Mitsuha is losing
            patiencewithher
            life. "I hate this town!" she screams out. "I hate this life! Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next
            life!"
            The next day, Mitsuha wakes up but not as herself. She is in Taki's body. She is quite disturbed to be a boy
            andallthat entails physically. Finding out she has overslept, she quickly gets dressed and heads out,
            suddenly
            struckthatshe is finally walking around Tokyo. Mitsuha (as Taki) arrives to school hours late and is
            accosted
            by his friendsShinta and Tsukasa, who note that Taki has been acting weird as well. They suggest going to a
            café, and Mitsuhareadily agrees as there are none where she lives. Getting a call on Taki's phone, she
            realizes Taki has a job atarestaurant and she is going to be late.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mitsuha goes to work but being Taki is harder than it looks. She is unprepared to work in a restaurant,
            making
            mistakes all night. It finally comes to a head, when a man tries to con the place for free food. Mitsuha
            is overwhelmed and when the man wants to pick a fight, Taki's older co-worker Ms. Okudera comes over and
            handlesthesituation, though the man cuts her skirt with a box cutter out of spLater, Okudera tells Taki that
            she followed the handbook to handle the situation though she wished she couldhavedone something more severe
            to
            the man who was clearly conning the restaurant. Noticing the cut in Ms. Okuderasskirt, Mitsuha offers to fix
            it. Ms. Okudera is charmed by this, saying Takis has been changing lately, and sheischarmed that he now has
            a
            feminine side.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next day, Taki is back to normal and knows nothing of the previous day. The staff he works with wants to
            know
            more details with his relationship with Ms. Okudera, but he has no idea what they are talking about. Ms.
            Okudera
            comes in and tells them all to have a good day, winking at Taki, which makes him blush.
            By this point, Taki and Mitsuha realize their body switching dreams are actually happening, and take steps
            tohelpout each other if they switch bodies. Writing notes to each other on their smart phones, and in
            notebooks, theyeachset ground rules so they don't step on each others toes. Mitsuhas rules are more
            concerned
            with etiquette, nothaving him taking showers as her (so hell see her naked) and other social cues. Taki
            gives
            her tips on his jobandtells her not to blow all his hard earned money on sweets, which only makes him have
            to
            take more shifts at therestaurant.
            Despite trying to play nice, both cant help but have a little fun at the others expense. Taki makes a few
            peoplefall in love with Mitsuha at school while Mitsuha flirts with Ms. Okudera, giving Taki a real shot
            with
            her.Both ofthem are livid with the others meddling, both noting that, I dont want a relationship!
          </p>

          <p>
            One day, Taki switches with Mitsuha on a weekend day. It turns out to be the day Mitsuha, Hitoha, and
            Yotsuhaaretraveling to the family shrine far into the forest. While they walk, Hitoha talks to them about
            the
            idea of aunion;whether it is a braid they created, time itself, or even taking a drink, unions are made
            every
            day.
            The three make it to the shrine and make an offering of the sake they made during the ritual.
            Taki wakes up. Checking his phone, he notices a text from Ms. Okudera, saying she cant wait to meet
            him.Confused,he checks the notes in his phone, and realized that Mitsuha had set him up on a date with Ms.
            Okudera.15 minutesfrom then. Taki quickly gets dressed and races out of his house, racing to meet her.
            Meanwhile, Mitsuha gets ready for her day, using her braid to tie up her hair. She realizes Taki and Ms.
            Okuderaare most likely on their date at that moment. She looks into the mirror and sees that she is crying.
            She issurprised atfirst but then realizes the truth; she wanted to have that date with Taki herself. Try as
            she may, she isbeginningto fall for a boy she has never met.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taki meets up with Ms. Okudera and go to a nice, if expensive restaurant. Though they both share a mutual
            crush,
            Taki is nervous and unsure how to act. His mind is somewhere else. At one point, they look at a photo
            display,and
            Taki is taken by a group of shots that remind him of Mitsuhas town. Ms. Okudera comes up to him and
            pointedlystates
            she became more attracted to him once he starting acting odd, but he has changed again. He has become
            someoneelse.
            Later, Taki tries to extend the date but Ms. Okudera declines. She notes that is clear that Taki has a crush
            on
            someone else; that is why he is acting so different.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taki, making a decision, tries to call Mitsuha.
            Back in Itomori, Mitsuha cuts her hair. She goes to the local town festival with her friends. The comet
            finally
            becomes visible, and in a field, Mitsuha stares in awe. She sees a part of the comet break off and fall.
            Her eyes widen
            Back in Tokyo, Taki is sad when the call cannot be connected. He wishes they could switch again, but after
            that night, it never happened ag
            Days pass, and Taki goes through the motions. He begins to sketch Itomori from memory, trying desperately to
            figure
            out where she lives, with little luck. One day, he decides to leave the city to find the town and finally
            meet
            Mitsuha. Tagging along are Ms. Okudera and Tsukasa, who are there for moral support. They are curious and
            charmed by
            Takis mystery girl, while Taki must be coy about how he met
            The trio travel many places but no one knows the town Taki has drawn. About to give up, Taki and his friends
            stop at
            a local restaurant. The owner recognizes the place as Itomori, but when Taki asks how far away it is, the
            owner goes
            silent for a moment before explaining three years before the town was destroyed by a comet fragment, killing
            over 500 people.
          </p>

          <p> Taki is taken to the outskirts of Itomori where he sees little left of the town. He tries to show his
            friends the notes Mitsuha left for him on his phone, only for them to disappear. He doesnt know what to
            think.
            The trio goes to a local library and sees the reports about the tragedy and the list of the dead. Mitsuha,
            her
            sister, and her friends are among the dead. Taki is shocked and heartbroken; he is somehow linked to a dead
            girl, who died three years ago.
            The three get a hotel room for the night. Tsukasa asks Ms. Okuderas opinion on Takis recent behavior and
            what
            he claims about Mitsuha. Ms. Okudera, while admitting it is all strange, notes she always found Taki to be
            nice, but he became even a better person because of this girl.
            Later that night, Ms. Okudera and Taki talk. She notices a braid on Takis wrist. Taki says he got a few
            years
            ago, but he doesn't remember who gave it to him or why, though he wears it often for good luck.
            As he sleeps, Mitsuha calls out to him to remember.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next morning, Ms. Okudera wakes up to find a note from Taki to tell them to go home without him. He has
            togosomewhere first.
            Taki travels to Itomori, and finds his way to the shrine of Mitsuhas family, still intact. He travels inside
            andfinds the sake Mitsuha and her sister left. Taki thinks if he drinks some of her sake, he can make one
            last connection and perhaps save her.
            Taki drinks some, but as he stands up, he trips and falls. As he does, he takes a journey, and sees all
            ofMitsuha'slife; her birth, happiness with her parents, the birth of her sister, the illness and death of
            her
            mother, herfathers abandonment of the family and his duties, her grandmother caring for them, and her death
            by
            the comet.
            Taki wakes up in Mitsuha's body. He realizes he has one last chance. Seeing the television, he realizes it
            isthe day of the comet, and the towns destruction. Trying to talk to Hitoha, Hitoha realizes that someone
            else
            inhabitsher granddaughter, as she had a similar phenomenon happen to her when she was younger. Taki wonders
            if
            Mitsuhasfamily line had these connections. Taki (as Mitsuha) tells Hitoha about the comet but is told no one
            willbelievethem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Undeterred, Taki finds Mitsuha's friends Katsuhiko and Sayaka and tell them what will happen. Despite
            doubtingwhatthey have been told, they believe her enough to help. They make a plan to knock out the towns
            power
            withexplosivestaken from Katsuhiko's father's construction company. Sayaka then will get on the emergency
            broadcast stationandtell everyone to evacuate to the school, well out of the blast radius of the comet.
            However,
            they will need toconvince the mayor, Mitsuhas father, of the severity.
            Taki goes to Mitsuha's father, but all the man can see is that his daughter has gone insane and orders her
            tosee
            adoctor. Enraged, Taki grabs him by the tie and screams, You son of a---but they both stop. Who are you?
            Mitsuhasfather asks, also seeing that his daughter is not standing before him. Nevertheless, the warning
            falls
            on deafears.Taki, thinking his body with Mitsuha inside is near the Shrine, races up there to meet her.
            Meanwhile, Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body in the present day and sees the town destroyed. Does that mean
            Idied?she asks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mitsuha remembers the day she went to Tokyo, hoping to meet Taki, thinking that even though they
            weretechnicallystrangers, if they were to meet, they would know their connection. By chance she met him on
            the
            train, though hedidnot recognize her (as their connection would only begin 3 years after her death).
            Heartbroken, she leaves thetrain,but Taki senses something and calls out to her. She takes out her braid and
            flings it to him, asking him torememberher name. She was the one who gave him the braid and thus linked them
            together.
            Taki and Mitsuha finally are at the shrine, but cannot see each other, being separated by time itself.
            However,during the Magic Hour in a certain spot, they can finally see each other, and meet for the first
            time.
            Takireturnsher braid and she ties up her hair. Taki suggests they write each other names on their hands so
            they wontforget.Taki writes his, but when she goes to write her name, the connection is broken.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taki wakes up, back in his body, on the outskirts of the still destroyed Itomori. He cannot remember why he
            camethere, or the name of a girl that haunts him. He heads home to Tokyo.
            Back in the past, Mitsuha, knowing what will happen enacts her plan with her friends. They blow up the
            powergridwith explosives, switching on emergency power. Sayaka then tells the entire town of forest fires in
            an effort togetpeople to the school. Though some take heed of the warning, not enough people do. Plus, the
            Mayor is trying tofigure out who is sending out this false warning. Eventually, Sayaka is caught and the
            warning is turned off.Katsuhiko tells Mitsuha that unless she is able to convince her father, everything is
            lost.
            Mitsuha begins to run, but becomes increasingly despondent as she cannot remember Takis name. She trips
            andfalls,looking at her hand. She sees that Taki, instead of writing his name, wrote I LOVE YOU instead.
            Shocked and intears, she continues to run, before reuniting with her father in a building.
            The comet fragment still hits the town, destroying it.
          </p>

          <p>
            5 years later...
          </p>
          <p>

            Taki has graduated from high school and college, and is now trying to enter the work force as an architect.
            However,
            his passionate and idealistic views on preserving cities in case of disasters make him look foolish to
            interviewers,
            which lead him to get few if any offers.
            Taki gets a call from Ms. Okudera, asking to meet up. They catch up, and she mentions they day they went to
            Itomori. Taki says he doesnt remember much of that day or why he was momentarily obsessed with the town. It
            turns out that reality has changed. Mitsuha was able to convince her father of the danger. That on top of
            her
            daring plan, led to the entire town to be evacuated to an area outside of the blast radius. The town was
            decimated, yet no one died. Still, Taki has no idea of his connection to averting a tragedy or the girl he
            help save.
            As they part, Ms. Okudera tells Taki that she hopes he one day finds happiness. Taki notes the same, though
            it
            has felt as if he has spent years searching for it, yearning for something, or rather someone.
            In a diner, he hears a couple bicker over wedding plans. We see it is Sayaka and Katsuhiko, who survived
            thanks to Taki and Mitsuha. Taki feels a momentary feeling of connection, but brushes it off as nothing.
            Taki, not knowing why fully, searches the streets every day for a woman whose hair is tied up with a
            specific
            braid.
            At one point, Taki and Mitsuha cross paths in the street, but dont look back, deciding their weird feelings
            are nothing.
          </p>
          <p>One day, finally, they see each other on different subways. Though they are not sure why, they feel
            aconnection.After getting off, they scramble around the city, searching for each other. Taki sees a woman at
            the top of astaircase and passes her by, as she walks down. Once again, they feel a stirring and almost
            ignore
            it once more.However, Taki cannot take it anymore and calls out to the woman. It is Mitsuha. He asks if they
            have met before.Mitsuha looks at him with tears in her eyes. She says that she feels the same way.
            Simultaneously, they ask,"Can Iask you your name?"
            We are left to infer they will recover their memories and finally be together, in love.

            view
            shows the city's lake in its original form (before comet hits the city). It shouldn't be the case, as Taki
